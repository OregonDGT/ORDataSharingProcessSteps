### Define
> [!TIP]
> Agency identifies need and develops a proposed use case for data sharing.

#### Guidance needed:  

1. Support on scoping, identifying, and evaluating potential use cases for data sharing 

#### Dependencies/Assumptions: 

1. Agencies have done program evaluation or use case scoping and have an identified need/challenge that data sharing can effectively address [0. Understand] 
2. Agencies have baseline awareness of their own data collections and program data collection via a data inventory, catalog, or other governance mechanism [0. Understand] 
3. Agencies have means to access/understand data being collected by other agencies to identify potential data sharing use cases across programs  

#### Core Activities for PhaseStep 1: 

1. Identify one or more agency needs that can be solved using cross-agency data sharing
2. Outline specifics of what data will be used and for what purpose
3. Develop list of partners and expected roles and responsibilities for accomplishing the use case
4. Document the key information necessary to develop a use case proposal
5. Determine specific need and construct a business case to articulate how this data use case will address this need
