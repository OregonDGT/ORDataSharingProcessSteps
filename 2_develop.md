### Develop
> [!TIP]
> The overall data sharing process, template use case, instructions for completing a use case, how to facilitate development of a use case or further refine from the “define” step.
#### Guidance Needed:  

1. Definition on what baseline awareness or maturity is, some level of program or data inventory so agency knows what data they collect. 

#### Dependencies/Assumptions
1. Agencies have the tools needed to successfully engage each other to discuss use cases: perform initial outreach, share a proposed use case, facilitate discussion/feedback and scoping
2. Agencies who sign the MOU are committing to “getting to yes” when scoping use cases, or to clearly documenting why a use case should not move forward [legal, ethical, good idea].

#### Core Activities for Step/Phase 0
1. Fill out the Business Use Case Proposal Template (with assistance from DGT resource)
2. Hold sessions to refine the use case from step 1 into a workable Business Use Case Proposal; goal is to have something that is technically executable
 
#### Templates/Resources
