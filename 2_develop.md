### Process & Artifacts
> [!TIP]
> The overall data sharing process, template use case, instructions for completing a use case, how to facilitate development of a use case or further refine from the “define” step.
#### Guidance Needed:  

1. Definition on what baseline awareness or maturity is, some level of program or data inventory so agency knows what data they collect. 

#### Dependencies/Assumptions
1. Agencies have the tools needed to successfully engage each other to discuss use cases: perform initial outreach, share a proposed use case, facilitate discussion/feedback and scoping
2. Agencies who sign the MOU are committing to “getting to yes” when scoping use cases, or to clearly documenting why a use case should not move forward [legal, ethical, good idea].

#### Core Activities for Step/Phase 2
1. Fill out the Business Use Case Proposal Template (with assistance from DGT resource)
2. Hold sessions to refine the use case from step 1 into a workable Business Use Case Proposal; goal is to have something that is technically executable
 
#### Templates/Resources
1. DGT Resources
     - [Oregon Business Use Case Proposal Template (1).docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22033664/Oregon.Business.Use.Case.Proposal.Template.1.docx)
        - Critical template necessary to move to the next step; documents all information needed to complete your use case proposal
2. External Resources
     - [Cal HHS Business Use Case Proposal Template.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22033748/Cal.HHS.Business.Use.Case.Proposal.Template.docx) and [Cal HHS Business Use Case Proposal Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22033750/Cal.HHS.Business.Use.Case.Proposal.Instructions.pdf)
        - Another organization’s approach to documenting use case proposals
     - [Data Audit Worksheet.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22033757/Data.Audit.Worksheet.xlsx)
     - [Data Labs Field-Level Mapping Template.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22033772/Data.Labs.Field-Level.Mapping.Template.xlsx)    
#### Deliverables- at the end of the step an agency should have completed the following:
1. Finalized Draft Use Case Proposal.
