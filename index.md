# Oregon Data Sharing Process & Artifacts

> [!NOTE]
> This document outlines Oregonâ€™s Data Sharing Process and associated artifacts, providing a streamlined guide for implementing an enterprise-level Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). With step-by-step instructions, templates, and resources, it supports agencies in identifying, defining, and executing secure and compliant data-sharing use cases to enhance public services and collaboration statewide.  


#### Six Step Pilot Data Sharing Process: 0-5
The '0-5' process steps provide a structured framework for data sharing, guiding agencies from understanding their data landscape (Step 0) to executing and refining data-sharing use cases (Step 5). Each step includes key activities, dependencies, and resources to ensure a secure, compliant, and effective approach to inter-agency collaboration. <i> For the pilot project, Data Governance and Transparency (DGT) will be providing resources, facilitators, and observers to support and refine the use of this data sharing process and associated resources</i>.
