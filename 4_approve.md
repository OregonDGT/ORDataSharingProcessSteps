### Approve
> [!TIP]
> Agency whose data is requested must review and either approve or dispute/deny the data sharing request.
> 
#### Guidance Needed:  

1. DGT will need a documented process for use case review and vetting, as well as a clear process for what the options are when reviewing a submitted use case (Approve, deny w/proposed alternative, deny w/out proposed alternative…) for agencies to utilize.

#### Dependencies/Assumptions
1. Data sharing process via MOU is clearly documented so agencies understand their options.
2. Process for “dispute” or conflict resolution/discussion and areas to engage CDO are documented.
3. DGT has clarity of internal processes to know how to respond to agencies engaging in either formal or informal advice seeking related to data sharing.
4. RACI is clear on the role of CDO, DOJ, and other external parties in assisting agencies with navigating legal questions, privacy questions, etc.

#### Core Activities for Step/Phase 0
1. Determine if Use Case is appropriate and the data sharing request is one the agency can approve support
2. Provide feedback for DGT resource on process for effectively reaching a decision on data sharing request
3. Make a formal decision and submit that decision in writing to requesting agency (approve, dispute, or deny)

#### Templates/Resources
1. DGT Resources
     - Execute Use Case Recommendations 
       - Detailed guide for how to execute the use case for a variety of roles
     -  State Agency Resources
       - ODE Houseless Student Data Briefs, Understanding Student Houselessness Data Brief
         - Examples of use case write-ups and report-outs
     - External Resources
       - Data Labs Agile Rapid Prototyping
         - Process for quickly determining viability of prototype solutions or approaches for use cases

#### Deliverables- at the end of the step an agency should have completed the following:
1. Finalized Draft Use Case Proposal.
