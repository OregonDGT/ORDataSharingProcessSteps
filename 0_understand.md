## Step/Phase 0: Understand

### Understand
> [!TIP]
> Agencies establish baseline awareness of their own data and programs to understand what they collect and do not collect, identify ongoing programmatic needs, and pain points.  

100. First list item
     - First nested list item
       - Second nested list item
         
#### Guidance needed:  

1. Definition on what baseline awareness or maturity is, some level of program or data inventory so agency knows what data they collect. 

#### Dependencies/Assumptions: 

1. Agencies have a Lead Data Steward or other identified party responsible for agency data inventory completion.
2. Agencies have completed an initial data inventory or are actively developing one.
3. Agencies have data dictionaries to help them understand the data that’s intended to be shared and used. 
4. Agencies have documented (or are actively documenting) regulated data and their associated regulatory or privacy accountabilities. 
5. Agencies have identified roles and responsibilities related to data sharing and data sharing use case review and approval. 
6. Agencies have completed the executing the MOU [link to resources].   

### Core activities for phasestep 0: 

1. Evaluate existing data related to potential use cases
2. Determine what data is and isn’t collected currently (this is critical- data that isn’t currently collected will be much harder to fold into a use case)
3. Identify internal SMEs for potential use cases, including data users, program leaders, and key partners
4. Fill out data inventory template; engage DGT facilitator to assist

### Deliverables- at the end of the step an agency should have completed the following:   

Completed data inventory template. 

Identification of regulated data and associated responsibilities. 
1. What problem are we trying to solve? 
2. What outcomes do we want to achieve?
3. How will data work to meet our mission?
4. What kinds of data do we need access to?
5. Who are the main stakeholders and how do we engage them?
6. How are we going to track, assess and monitor progress?
7. Can we pilot a few projects and start small? What can we learn   from starting small and building out?
8. Do we have the right workforce in place?
9. Have we received buy-in from leadership and across teams?
10. Are we delivering on the needs of our customers? How do we know?

>Use best practice resources to build a use case around a particular **opportunity, issue or problem**. 

## What is the problem you are trying to solve?

This Play helps Departments develop a use case; define the customer/stakeholder who would benefit from implementing the use case; and assess the impact after the implementation.

>As a **[user role]** I want to do **[scope]** in order to achieve **[measurable objective]** to serve **[stakeholder group]**.

This Play can also help Departments navigate the Stage 1 Business Analysis.

Consider [creating a Logic Model](https://www.practicalplaybook.org/resources/develop-logic-model){:target="_blank"} to demonstrate how a program achieves an intended outcome or impact and where data-driven interventions can further program goals.

There are dozens of ways each Department can use data, and the applications can seem endless. It will be important to pick one core mission problem, and then gradually build and grow programs based on lessons learned.
