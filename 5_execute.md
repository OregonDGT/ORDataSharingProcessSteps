### Process & Artifacts
> [!NOTE]
> Agencies execute use case according to the proposal.
> 
#### Guidance Needed:  

1. For Pilot, agencies will have a prescribed suggested output that we are intending to guide them to. For ongoing implementation, this section should be considered part of a living document/playbook to help guide agencies.

#### Dependencies/Assumptions
1. Agencies have completed appropriate solution analysis in Steps 1-3 and have identified any outputs, deliverables, or overall outcomes from their specific use case.

#### Core Activities for Step/Phase 5
1. If necessary, review use case and determine new scope based on feedback from previous steps
2. Develop a plan for implementation (currently no template or articulated process for DGT- will be part of development for the next project)
3. Notify all stakeholders of intent to execute and timelines for execution

#### Templates/Resources
1. DGT Resources
     - [Execute Use Case Recommendations.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22280887/Execute.Use.Case.Recommendations.pdf)
       - Detailed guide for how to execute the use case for a variety of roles
     - State Agency Resources
       - <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/StudentSuccess/Documents/SNHIResearchBrief1.pdf">ODE Houseless Student Data Briefs</a>, <a href= "https://www.oregon.gov/ode/StudentSuccess/Documents/SNHIResearchBrief2.pdf">Understanding Student Houselessness Data Brief</a>
         - Examples of use case write-ups and report-outs
     - External Resources
          - <a href="https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/foundation-of-a-successful-data-project-agile-rapid-prototyping/">Data Labs Agile Rapid Prototyping</a>
             - Process for quickly determining viability of prototype solutions or approaches for use cases
#### Deliverables- at the end of the step an agency should have completed the following:
1. i.	Implemented use case outputs.
