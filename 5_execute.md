### Execute
> [!TIP]
> Agencies execute use case according to the proposal.
> 
#### Guidance Needed:  

1. For Pilot, agencies will have a prescribed suggested output that we are intending to guide them to. For ongoing implementation, this section should be considered part of a living document/playbook to help guide agencies.

#### Dependencies/Assumptions
1. Agencies have completed appropriate solution analysis in Steps 1-3 and have identified any outputs, deliverables, or overall outcomes from their specific use case.

#### Core Activities for Step/Phase 5
1. If necessary, review use case and determine new scope based on feedback from previous steps
2. Develop a plan for implementation (currently no template or articulated process for DGT- will be part of development for the next project)
3. Notify all stakeholders of intent to execute and timelines for execution

#### Templates/Resources
1. DGT Resources
     - Execute Use Case Recommendations 
       - Detailed guide for how to execute the use case for a variety of roles
     - State Agency Resources
       - ODE Houseless Student Data Briefs, Understanding Student Houselessness Data Brief
         - Examples of use case write-ups and report-outs
     - External Resources
       - Data Labs Agile Rapid Prototyping
        - Process for quickly determining viability of prototype solutions or approaches for use cases
#### Deliverables- at the end of the step an agency should have completed the following:
1. i.	Implemented use case outputs.
